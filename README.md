***“Essential Questions” for the Computer Science Program***

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

I realized that unless I keep my code confined to my local desktop, avoid pulling in any dependencies, and prevent others from accessing or using the application, it will never be fully secure. However, I understand that through adequate testing and following the fundamentals of secure DevOps practices during the design and maintenance of any code, program, or software, I can achieve a sufficient level of safety. One important aspect is continuously tracking and fine-tuning the code, program, or software until its deprecation to ensure the highest quality of safety.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program requires a combination of user research, empathy, and effective communication. The key aspect to consider when developing a program is to deliver a viable product that satisfies the customer's requirements and meets their expectations. Thus, it is crucial to ensure a clear understanding of their needs and ensure they comprehend the program's capabilities.

Furthermore, obtaining feedback from users during the design phase is invaluable. By actively seeking their input and incorporating their likes and dislikes into the program's design, it becomes more user-centric. This entails being open to criticism and flexible enough to accommodate changes that improve the user experience.

**How do I approach designing software?**

I adopted an incremental approach to the software design process, carefully breaking it down into smaller steps to establish a modular and object-oriented structure. This project has played a crucial role in enhancing my understanding and appreciation of the object-oriented programming mindset, evident in the well-organized arrangement of classes and objects.
